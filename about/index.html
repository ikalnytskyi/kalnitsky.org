  About Me
</h1>
    </header>

    <p>Hey there! My name is Ihor, and I'm a software engineer living in Kharkiv,
Ukraine. I love Open Source and you can find my contributions in a number of
projects on GitHub.</p>
<p>In 2019 I bought my first pair of inline skates, and since then it has become
my #1 hobby. In my spare time, I read fiction and enjoy watching movies with
friends. I also like to travel. I’ve traveled to a number of countries in
Europe, crossed the Atlantic to the USA and hiked in the Himalayas.</p>
<p>From an early age, I’ve been passionate about computers. When I grew up, I
decided to embrace my passion and become a Software Engineer. For more than
eight years I’ve been mastering this profession, and throughout the years I
realized it’s a never ending study. That’s why I decided to focus around
distributed computing and system design, two areas I’m the most interested in.</p>
<p>Nowadays I mostly use Python as a programming language of choice. However I
keep an eye on Rust since I found it promising.</p>
<p>The best way to contact me is by sending an email to <a href="mailto:ihor@kalnytskyi.com">ihor@kalnytskyi.com</a>.
