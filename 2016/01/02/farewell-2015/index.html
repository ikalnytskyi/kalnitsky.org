        <h1>
  Farewell, 2015!
</h1>
    </header>

    <p>I'm a little late to sum up, but better now than never. :) Well, 2015 was a
year of travels. I've never visited before so many places in one year, just
look at the record:</p>
<ul>
<li>Istanbul, Turkey</li>
<li>Minsk, Belarus</li>
<li>Zürich, Switzerland</li>
<li>Barcelona, Spain</li>
<li>Toronto, Canada</li>
<li>Niagara Falls, Canada</li>
<li>Silicon Valley, USA</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm so excited about them, and looking forward to have even more in 2016!</p>
<p>As for my programming life, nothing special has happened except, perhaps,
that I started doing less coding that I'd want to. You see, in the end of
fall two events took place:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've been elected for Fuel-Python component lead position.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Fuel">Fuel</a> has joined OpenStack Big Tent umbrella.</li>
</ul>
<p>So now my main focus is to make design decisions and choose direction to go.
I barely have time for code review, but I hope it'll be resolved soon.</p>
<p>Besides that, <a href="https://holocron.readthedocs.org">Holocron</a> - an extendable static site generator behind this
blog - was finally released. Thanks a lot to my friend <a href="https://www.facebook.com/andrii.gamaiunov">Andrii Gamaiunov</a>
for putting effort to make this happen. I'm glad to see how it's going despite
lack of time, though there're few major things to be done before I can say
<em>«It's 1.0 release»</em>.</p>
<p>Summarizing: 2015 was a good year, and I expect 2016 to be at least as good
as 2015 was, but hope it will be even better!</p>
<p>Happy Holidays!</p>
