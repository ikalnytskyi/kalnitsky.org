Farewell, 2015!
===============

I'm a little late to sum up, but better now than never. :) Well, 2015 was a
year of travels. I've never visited before so many places in one year, just
look at the record:

 * Istanbul, Turkey
 * Minsk, Belarus
 * Zürich, Switzerland
 * Barcelona, Spain
 * Toronto, Canada
 * Niagara Falls, Canada
 * Silicon Valley, USA

I'm so excited about them, and looking forward to have even more in 2016!

As for my programming life, nothing special has happened except, perhaps,
that I started doing less coding that I'd want to. You see, in the end of
fall two events took place:

 * I've been elected for Fuel-Python component lead position.
 * [Fuel] has joined OpenStack Big Tent umbrella.

So now my main focus is to make design decisions and choose direction to go.
I barely have time for code review, but I hope it'll be resolved soon.

Besides that, [Holocron] - an extendable static site generator behind this
blog - was finally released. Thanks a lot to my friend [Andrii Gamaiunov]
for putting effort to make this happen. I'm glad to see how it's going despite
lack of time, though there're few major things to be done before I can say
*«It's 1.0 release»*.

Summarizing: 2015 was a good year, and I expect 2016 to be at least as good
as 2015 was, but hope it will be even better!

Happy Holidays!
