        <h1>Mad Map: Python Road</h1>
      </header>

      <p>I've been using Python for several years and I used to think there was nothing
in the language that can surprise me. It was so until recently. The story I'm
about to tell is about how even so simple and well-known thing like <code>map()</code>
function can surprise you after years of using, and what led me to believe
that it's poorly designed.</p>
<p>So, what's wrong with <code>map()</code>? We use it everyday and everywhere, and it seems
OK, and none of us have met any problems. Yes, indeed, <code>map()</code> works just fine
if you use it how it's intended to be used. For instance, if you use <code>map()</code>
to multiply each element of some sequence by 2 -</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">])</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Just keep going, everything's ok. But let me show another usage example -</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;a&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;b&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;c&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">])</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Can you tell now what is <code>x</code>, ha? I always thought that <code>map()</code> function
receives precisely two arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>a function to apply;</li>
<li>a sequence to be processed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you imagine how surprised I was when it turned out that I was wrong?
Python has always been about readability, and even if you don't know the
language you can pretty much guess most of its parts intuitively. So I started
thinking what could possible be returned in this case? What <code>None</code> may mean in
this context? I recalled that if <code>None</code> is passed as a function argument to
<code>filter()</code> then only <em>truthy</em> elements are returned. Hm, maybe <code>map()</code> behaves
similar to <code>filter()</code> and returns a list of booleans? Let's check.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="nb">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>
<p>No, it's not :( So I went to the documentation and learned that if a function
argument is <code>None</code>, the identity function is assumed. In other words it's
equal to the following call -</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="nb">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Wait a minute. <code>None</code> means identity?! Does it make sense? Perhaps if we're
talking about default behaviour, but it makes no sense from a user point of
view. You know, it looks like &quot;pass <code>None</code> if you want to get identity
function behaviour&quot;. But let's go on.</p>
<p>I continued guessing about how <code>map()</code> should deal with two iterables? It was
obvious to me that <code>map()</code> should chain them: when first is over, the second
will be used.</p>
<p>Let's take a loot at the original snippet one more time.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;a&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;b&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;c&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">])</span>
</code></pre>
<p>What is <code>x</code>? Taking into account that was written above I was expecting <code>x</code> to
be -</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;a&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;b&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;c&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Boom! I missed again, because <code>x</code> was -</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"><span class="p">[(</span><span class="s1">&#39;a&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;b&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;c&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">)]</span>
</code></pre>
<p>And I stunned again because that means these two iterables were zipped, not
chained. Why zipped? I never asked for this! Is this really Python? I always
liked the language because of good design and good intentions. And when I
didn't know something it always fitted my expectations, but this was something
really weird.</p>
<p>I agree that someone may expect iterables to be zipped, but I'm so much
disappointed that that one may stuck upon expression that could not be
correctly guessed. I wish <code>map()</code> to be dead simple: receive one function and
one iterable, and leave zipping or chaining up to programmers. Moreover, I
wish a function argument to be always a function, no way to fallback to
default behaviour. If someone wants identity behaviour let's pass it
explicitly, no way to do it through <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>The most frustrating thing is that it hasn't been removed in Python 3, but
changed! First, you can't use <code>None</code> as identity function anymore (alleluia).
If you try to do that you'll fall with <code>TypeError</code> exception:</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable
</code></pre>
<p>Second, iterables are zipped by <code>zip()</code>, not <code>zip_longest()</code>. If the first
change seems rational, the second one is mad. It doesn't provide any benefits,
but may cause a lot of pain for those who porting some software to Python.
Why? You see, if two iterables are equal in size the behavior is still the
same -</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>language / expression</th>
<th><code>map(lambda x: x, ['a', 'b'], [1, 2])</code></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Python 2</td>
<td><code>[('a', 1), ('b', 2)]</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Python 3</td>
<td><code>[('a', 1), ('b', 2)]</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>if not, it's different -</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>language / expression</th>
<th><code>map(lambda x: x, ['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2])</code></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Python 2</td>
<td><code>[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', None)]</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Python 3</td>
<td><code>[('a', 1), ('b', 2)]</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I'm really really sad about such a mad <code>map()</code> and I wish I never knew about
that. I don't know why it was designed so, but I hope none of pythonistas will
use it and one day it will be removed from the language.</p>
